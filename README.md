* [Day 1](Day01.ipynb). File reading and simple list manipulation.

* [Day 2](Day02.ipynb). Dictionaries for a Rock-Paper-Scissor game.

* [Day 3](Day03.ipynb). String manipulation and search. Initially using `Counter` and `&` of dictionaries for efficient search of common items, then moved to `set`'s since they are the most natural tool for intersection search.
